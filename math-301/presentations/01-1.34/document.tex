Let $I_{n} = \bracks*{a_{n}, b_{n}}$ where for every $n \in \N$ there is
\[ I_{n} \supseteq I_{n + 1}. \]
We wish to show \[ \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}I_{n} \ne \emptyset. \]

\begin{proof}
Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be the sequences defining the bounds of $I_{n}$.
Let $\alpha = \sup\braces*{a_{n}}$ and $\beta = \inf\braces*{b_{n}}$.
Then, we know
\[ a_{1} \le a_{2} \le \ldots \le a_{n} \le \ldots \le \alpha \overbrace{ \le }^{?} \beta \le \ldots \le b_{n} \le \ldots \le b_{2} \le b_{1}. \]
Note that this proof \emph{does} use both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, since I was unsure how to go about showing
\[ \alpha \le b_{n} \quad \forall n \in \N, \]
since that seems to require showing the infimum of $(b_{n})$ is greater than (or equal to) $\alpha$.\\

\noindent
Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\alpha > \beta$. Then, we would find (by the ``no-gap lemma'') $\eps = \alpha - \beta > 0$ and see $\exists a_{n}$
such that $a_{n} > \alpha - \eps$. Similarly, there would be a $b_{n} < \alpha - \eps$. Then, we see
\[ a_{n} > \alpha - \eps > b_{n} \implies a_{n} > b_{n}. \]
This is a contradiction, and so $\alpha \le \beta$.

\noindent
If ever $a_{n} = b_{n}$, then for all $m \ge n$, we see
\[ a_{m} = b_{m} = a_{n} \]
and this would also mean $\alpha = \beta = a_{n}$, and even that
\[ \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}I_{n} = \set*{\alpha}. \]

\noindent
Now, if $a_{n} \ne b_{n}$ for all $n$, we then would see that because of the inherent definition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and the fact $\alpha \le \beta$,
\[ \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}I_{n} = \bracks{\alpha, \beta} \ne \emptyset. \]
More precisely, $\abs*{\bracks{\alpha, \beta}} = \abs*{\R}$, which is \emph{slightly} more than zero.

\end{proof}
