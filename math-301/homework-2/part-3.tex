  \item Assume $(a_{n})$ is bounded and $(b_{n}) \to 0$. Show that $(a_{n}b_{n}) \to 0$.
        \begin{proof}
          Since $(a_{n})$ is bounded, $\abs{a_{n}} < C$ for all $n$ (where $C$ is not minimal, but \textit{is} finite).
          The reason $<$ is the proper relation here instead of $\le$ is to avoid dividing by zero.
          Then, we see
          \[
            \abs*{a_{n}b_{n}} = \abs{a_{n}}\abs{b_{n}} \le C\abs*{b_{n}}.
          \]

          Let $\eps > 0$, and note that $\eps/C > 0$ also. Choose $N$ so that $\abs{b_{n}} < \eps/C$ for all $n > N$.
          Then for $n > N$,
          \[
            \abs*{a_{n}b_{n} - 0} < \abs*{Cb_{n}} = C\abs*{b_{n}} < C \cdot \frac{\eps}{C} = \eps
          \]

          Thus, $(a_{n} \cdot b_{n}) \to 0$ as well.
        \end{proof}
