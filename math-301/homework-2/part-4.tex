\item Let $a_{1} = 1$, and define the sequence $(a_{n})$ such that
\[
  a_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2 + a_{n}}.
\]

Determine whether $(a_{n})$ converges, and if so the limit.

\begin{proof}
  Firstly, we want to show that $(a_{n})$ is bounded.
  We see that $a_{2} = \sqrt{3} < 2$. Now, assume $a_{n} < 2$ for some $n$, and consider $a_{n + 1}$.
  \[
    a_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2 + a_{n}} < \sqrt{2 + 2} = 2.
  \]

  Thus, we know $(a_{n})$ is bounded by 2. Now, let us prove $(a_{n})$ is monotonic.
  For the case $n = 1$, we see
  \[
    a_{n + 1} - a_{n} = \sqrt{3} - 1 \approx 1.73 > 0.
  \]
  Now, assuming this holds for some $n > 0$, we note
  \begin{align*}
    a_{n + 2} - a_{n + 1} &= \sqrt{a_{n + 1} + 2} - \sqrt{a_{n} + 2}\\
    &= \frac{a_{n + 1} + 2 - a_{n} - 2}
      {\sqrt{a_{n + 1} + 2} + \sqrt{a_{n} + 2}}\\
    &= \frac{a_{n + 1} - a_{n}}{\sqrt{a_{n + 1} + 2} + \sqrt{a_{n} + 2}} > 0.
  \end{align*}
  Since we know the numerator \emph{and} denominator are positive numbers, so the difference $a_{n + 2} - a_{n + 1}$ is as well.
  Thus, $(a_{n})$ is monotone increasing. By MCT, $(a_{n})$ then converges.
  Now, if $L = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty}a_{n + 1} \implies L = \sqrt{2 + L}$.
  Thus, solving for $L$, we see
  \begin{align*}
    L &= \sqrt{L + 2}\\
    L^{2} -L - 2 &= 0\\
    (L - 2)(L + 1) &= 0.
  \end{align*}
  Thus, we then know $L = -1$ or $2$. We know the limit is positive though, and as such we can say $(a_{n}) \to 2$.
\end{proof}
